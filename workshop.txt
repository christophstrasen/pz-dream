title=[42SP] DREAM — Declarative REactive Authoring Modules
description=DREAM - Meta mod and examples for the DREAM library suite (Build 42)

NOT TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER. DON'T USE THERE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. thx.

DREAM is a maintainer-curated bundle mod with examples and documentation for:
- WorldObserver (world sensing)
- PromiseKeeper (persisted situation to action orchestration)
- SceneBuilder (declarative scene spawning)
- LQR and reactivex (foundational libraries)

This is aimed at mid-level Lua mod developers who want reusable building blocks,
not gameplay content. By itself, this mod is mainly an entrypoint and examples.
