title=[42SP] DREAM — Declarative REactive Authoring Modules
description=[h1]DREAM - Declarative REactive Authoring Modules[/h1]
description=
description=A set of high-level lua modules for Project Zomboid [42SP] intended to help authors structure world-driven logic through composable, declarative building blocks.
description=
description=[h2]Core Goals & Design Principles[/h2]
description=
description=[b]1. Optionality[/b]
description=Each module is designed to stand on its own. They can be used independently or combined as needed.
description=
description=[b]2. Opinionated Separation of Concerns[/b]
description=Following the philosophy of reactive, world state–driven logic — sensing situations, deciding when actions are allowed to occur, and achieving desired effects on the world.
description=Concepts like observations, promises, and scenes are expressed in APIs and lifecycles, encouraging a shared vocabulary without prescribing a single way of working.
description=
description=[b]3. Composability & Reusability[/b]
description=Offering building blocks that capture recurring patterns at a higher level than raw events or tick logic.
description=By composing these blocks, authoring logic can become more compact and readable, with the goal of supporting faster iteration and more maintainable features over time.
description=
description=[b]4. Control & Extensibility[/b]
description=Working out of the box, while exposing settings and public interfaces for adjustment, extension through registration, and patching where needed.

description=[h2]Is this for you?[/h2]
description=
description=This suite is intended for experienced Project Zomboid modders.
description=
description=It may be worth exploring if you are working on larger or longer-lived mods and find yourself wanting more structure as features interact and accumulate.
description=
description=It is [b]not[/b] intended as an introduction to modding. If you are new to Project Zomboid modding or still learning Lua fundamentals, this is likely not the right starting point.
description=
description=The modules are under active development, currently focused on single-player, and may change as ideas are refined. While individual parts are usable on their own, the overall approach has not yet been validated in large, production-scale mods.

description=
description=[h2]How the Pieces Fit Together[/h2]
description=
description=At a high level, DREAM supports a common flow found in world-driven gameplay systems:
description=
description=[quote]
description=[b]Something becomes true in the world → a decision is made → something happens[/b]
description=[/quote]
description=
description=DREAM does not require this structure, but it is designed to [i]support and encourage[/i] it by providing dedicated modules for each stage.
description=
description=[h3]1. WorldObserver — Sensing the world[/h3]
description=
description=[b]WorldObserver[/b] focuses on [i]observing[/i] the game world and turning raw state into meaningful signals.
description=
description=Instead of manually scanning tiles, entities, or events in isolation, mods declare [i]interest[/i] in certain conditions (for example: nearby corpses, entered buildings, changing environments) and receive [b]observation streams[/b] as those conditions evolve.
description=WorldObserver is designed to support [b]collaborative sensing across multiple mods[/b], consolidating shared observation work and helping avoid redundant scans that can negatively impact performance.
description=
description=These streams represent [i]situations becoming true or changing over time[/i], and can be consumed directly or combined into higher-level signals.
description=
description=[h3]2. PromiseKeeper — Gating, scheduling, and remembering[/h3]
description=
description=[b]PromiseKeeper[/b] sits at the decision boundary.
description=
description=Given a situation (from WorldObserver, a vanilla event, or custom logic), it answers questions like:
description=
description=[list]
description=[*][i]Should this run at all?[/i]
description=[*][i]Should it only run once?[/i]
description=[*][i]How often is it allowed to run?[/i]
description=[*][i]Should it persist across reloads?[/i]
description=[/list]
description=
description=Promises encode these decisions explicitly and persist their outcomes, helping avoid duplicate triggers, accidental re-execution, or scattered state flags.
description=
description=[h3]3. SceneBuilder — Acting on the world[/h3]
description=
description=[b]SceneBuilder[/b] is responsible for [i]materializing outcomes[/i] in the game world.
description=
description=It provides a declarative way to author scenes — collections of world changes such as corpses, containers, items, zombies, or environmental details — with built-in support for fallback behavior, placement logic, and determinism where desired.
description=
description=Scenes are typically triggered once a promise is fulfilled, but SceneBuilder can also be used independently wherever structured world authoring is needed.
description=
description=[h3]Putting it together[/h3]
description=
description=In practice, many features follow this pattern:
description=
description=1. [b]Observe[/b] a situation in the world (WorldObserver)
description=2. [b]Decide[/b] if and when something should happen (PromiseKeeper)
description=3. [b]Materialize[/b] a result in the world (SceneBuilder)

description=Modifications to this mod are welcome. Ideally as a PR on GitHub. You may publish your own version on the Steam Workshop under the condition that you give credit, clearly label the modded version and refer to the original. If in doubt get in touch via a GitHub issue.
