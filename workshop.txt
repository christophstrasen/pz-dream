title=[42SP] DREAM — Declarative REactive Authoring Modules
description=A set of high-level lua modules for Project Zomboid (Build 42, Single Player) intended to help authors structure world-driven logic through composable, declarative building blocks.

NOT TESTED IN MULTIPLAYER. DON'T USE THERE. thx.

DREAM is a maintainer-curated bundle mod with examples and documentation for:
- WorldObserver (world sensing)
- PromiseKeeper (persisted situation to action orchestration)
- SceneBuilder (declarative scene spawning)
- LQR and reactivex (prerequisite libraries)

This suite is intended for experienced Project Zomboid modders.

It may be worth exploring if you are working on larger or longer-lived mods and find yourself wanting more structure as features interact and accumulate.

It is **not** intended as an introduction to modding. If you are new to Project Zomboid modding or still learning Lua fundamentals, this is likely not the right starting point.

The modules are under active development, currently focused on single-player, and may change as ideas are refined. While individual parts are usable on their own, the overall approach has not yet been validated in large, production-scale mods.
