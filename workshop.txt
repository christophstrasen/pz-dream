description=It may be worth exploring if you are working on larger or longer-lived mods and find yourself wanting more structure as features interact and accumulate.

description=It is **not** intended as an introduction to modding. If you are new to Project Zomboid modding or still learning Lua fundamentals, this is likely not the right starting point.

description=The modules are under active development, currently focused on single-player, and may change as ideas are refined. While individual parts are usable on their own, the overall approach has not yet been validated in large, production-scale mods.
