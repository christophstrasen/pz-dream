# Contributing to pz-dream

`pz-dream` is the meta-mod repo for the DREAM mod family. It is usually changed when:
- the suite dependency list changes
- examples / educational material changes

Maintainer convenience repo (multi-repo sync/watch): https://github.com/christophstrasen/DREAM

## Development quickstart

See: `development.md`.

## Expectations

- Keep dependency changes deliberate and explained (they affect the whole suite).
- Avoid breaking Workshop metadata or published mod IDs.
